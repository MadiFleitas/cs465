# module1
Prompt
Refer to the Module One Full Stack Guide linked in the Supporting Materials section below. Before you begin, clone your GitHub repository to a directory on your local computer, update the Git Ignore settings, and create a module1 branch to track the work done here.

Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:

Build a website using the Node.js server and the Express framework. Create a full stack web application based on the client wireframe. Begin by setting up the website folder in the server framework application called Express. This framework can serve static HTML content and support using JavaScript to code the necessary logic and behaviors required to meet the client requirements.
Correctly place static HTML content into the appropriate Express framework folders. Import the static HTML into the public folder and verify that the web server correctly sends the content to your web browser when you navigate to the proper URL.
Test the software installation to show that it renders the static HTML content in the browser. Test the software application by using input and output to show that the application can display the HTML in Express.
